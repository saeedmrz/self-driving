# self-driving

Self-driving car with no library using JavaScript.

## how to use

- Clone the project then open index.html (the main branch has AI visualizer and the novisualizer branch has no AI visualizer)
- You can change the value of "const N" inside the main.js to increase the number of cars to let the AI learns
- You can add new Dummy cars inside main.js "const traffic"

## future plans

- [ ]  Creating self-parking car
- [ ]  Add more features to the UI to change the number of cars and add more traffics
